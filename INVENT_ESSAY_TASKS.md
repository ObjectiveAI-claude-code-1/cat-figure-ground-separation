Task 1 — Assess Form Legibility: Examine the boundary between the cat and its immediate surroundings to determine whether the cat's physical shape is instantly readable. Look at where the cat's body ends and the background begins — the silhouette, the outline, the edges of the fur against whatever surface or space sits behind it. Determine whether these edges are crisp and self-evident, or whether the cat and its environment share so much visual similarity that the boundary dissolves and the form becomes ambiguous. A black cat on a dark blanket, a grey tabby against concrete, a white cat in snow — these are cases where form legibility breaks down because the viewer must work to reconstruct where the cat begins and the background ends. Strong form legibility means the cat's shape is obvious at a glance, without study or effort. This task concerns itself only with the immediate border between cat and background, not with other elements elsewhere in the frame.

Task 2 — Evaluate Tonal and Textural Contrast: Assess the degree of visual contrast between the cat and its environment across three dimensions: color, brightness, and texture. Where form legibility asks whether the cat's shape is distinguishable at all, this task asks how forcefully the cat asserts itself as a separate visual entity through the richness of that distinction. Consider whether the cat and its surroundings differ in color temperature or hue, whether one is significantly brighter or darker than the other, and whether the surface qualities differ — such as soft, complex fur against a smooth, flat, or uniform background. A ginger cat against a teal wall radiates color contrast. A dark cat caught in a beam of light against a dim room achieves brightness contrast. A fluffy Persian on a polished marble countertop offers textural contrast. The stronger and more varied these differences are, the more powerfully the cat separates from its environment — elevating the experience from merely being able to locate the cat to having the cat visually leap forward and command attention.

Task 3 — Judge Focal Dominance: Survey the entire photograph to determine whether the cat is the singular, commanding focal point or whether other elements in the frame compete for the viewer's attention. Identify anything that might rival the cat's visual weight: other animals, human faces, bold or brightly colored objects, dramatic scenery, complex architectural details, or any element with enough visual gravity to pull the eye away from the cat. Then assess whether the cat still wins. A cat can achieve strong focal dominance in a visually rich environment as long as nothing in that environment matches or exceeds its pull on the viewer's gaze — the cat might be the brightest element, the sharpest, the most centrally placed, or simply the most visually interesting thing in the frame. What matters is that when a viewer's eye enters the image, it arrives at the cat and stays there, with no other element powerful enough to divert attention away.
