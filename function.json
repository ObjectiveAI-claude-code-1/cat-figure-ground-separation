The image may come from any source and context — a professional studio portrait, a casual phone snapshot, a street photograph, or a wildlife capture. It may contain one cat or multiple cats.

The function assumes a cat is present and evaluates the perceptual experience of encountering it within the frame: whether the cat's form is immediately legible, whether it contrasts with its surroundings, and whether it commands the viewer's attention as the singular focal point."
