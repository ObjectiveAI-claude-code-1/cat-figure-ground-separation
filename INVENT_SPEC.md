Evaluate the visual separation of the cat in the photograph. Score how distinctly and clearly the cat stands apart from its background and from any competing visual elements in the frame.

This evaluation operates on two levels:

Level 1 — Separation from Background: Determine whether the cat is visually distinguishable from its immediate surroundings. The cat's form should be easy to perceive at a glance. A cat that blends, camouflages, or merges into the environment through similar colors, textures, or patterns has weak background separation. Examples of weak separation include a black cat on a black surface, a tabby against a similarly-striped rug, or a white cat against fresh snow. Strong separation means the cat contrasts with its background — through color, brightness, or texture — in a way that makes its form immediately legible.

Level 2 — Separation from Competing Elements: Determine whether the cat competes with other visually arresting elements in the frame for the viewer's attention. Other animals, people, bold objects, bright patterns, or dramatic scenery can all pull the viewer's eye away from the cat. When the cat must share attention with competing elements, its subject clarity is diminished. Strong separation means the cat exists in a visual environment where nothing else challenges its dominance as the focal point.

Evaluate the following:

- Is the cat's form immediately legible against its background, or does it blend into similarly colored or textured surroundings?
- Does the cat contrast with its environment through color, brightness, or texture?
- Are there other visually arresting elements in the frame — other animals, people, bold objects, or dramatic scenery — that compete with the cat for the viewer's attention?
- Is the cat the singular, undeniable focal point of the image, or is the viewer's gaze pulled in multiple directions?

A high score means the cat stands apart clearly from its background and faces no competition from other visual elements — it is the singular thing that commands the viewer's eye. A low score means the cat blends into its surroundings, is camouflaged by similar colors or patterns, or is visually overshadowed by competing elements in the frame.
